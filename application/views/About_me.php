					I’m a master coach, best-selling author and a passionate speaker. I’m the founder of the first women-only hedge fund, special counsellor in many corporations across the globe. I’ve found balance between work and life, now I’m a totally happy person, loving mother, inspiring speaker and writer, and firm investor, but it didn’t come easily. I've gone though hundreds of failures and complicated situations. You can use my previous experience in order not to fall into the same trap.

					In 2008, I wrote my first book Success Yourself, and it was a real success, forgive me the wordiness. My upcoming book Inflated Expectations: Free Yourself from Your Past, Live Your Present and Get the Future You Want is the guidebook for how to treat disappointment on the emotional, mental, behavioral and spiritual levels.

				<div class="col-md-4">
					Today, I support ordinary people in answering the questions: “Who Am I, What do I want, and How do I get it?” I am a master coach combining life coaching with the principles of behavior psychology. I'm totally passionate about supporting people out of suffering and limitation and into fulfillment.

					My current passion for coaching appeared when I was 26 and met my first life coach, Hendrick. I thought I was just going to get some proper advice about the troubles I was having with my ex-boyfriend and questions I had about my stuck career, but I ended up seeing and studying with Hendrick for over 5 years.

			<big>The work we did together was really life-changing. For example, I found the strength to get through my massive quarter-life crisis when I literally lost everything (the job of my dream, engagement with the guy I loved, almost all my money and health) and off anti-depressants and other drugs after being on them for 3 years.</big>

							My thirst for personal growth continued as I dived into self-help brochures and books, attended seminars and lecturers, got trained in NLP and eventually pursued my master’s degree in Behavior Psychology from the Syracuse University.

							Anyone may lose direction in his life or business. You may not know what to do next. Nothing pleases you in your job. You feel like you're not living the way you could, and it's torturing you. I know that feeling and can help you make life much easier!

							I will help you to freed yourself, to see more, to breath deeper, to set goals and achieve them no matter what. Knowing who you are and what you want is the best thing ever in life, so gift yourself such an opportunity.
						</p>
						<p>
							I use the professional approach that competently combines practical psychology and coaching. During the sessions, the deepest possible disclosure of talents is provided, you find your inner strength through natural and organic growth of personality. I have a special approach for each client and absence of templates, both at individual consultation, and in team work.
